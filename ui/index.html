			You may have heard of websites like <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">CodeAcademy <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>, where you can teach yourself web development and they are great places to learn. However, what these sites don't teach you is how to get started on your own computer.

			Once you're done with the basics, feel free to jump on to whatever tutorial site you like.
			Mixing and matching tutorials, experimenting, checking out other websites' code is all good for your learning. Sound good?
